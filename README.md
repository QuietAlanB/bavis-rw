# bavis-rw
Possibly the best game ever conceieved - a game where you type "bavis" over and over. This was made in the past (by me as well) but this is a massive rework of the original game.

NOTES IF YOU DECIDE TO PLAY:
- Do not play this in it's own window (By double left clicking the file, for example) otherwise the statistics at the end will not show. Instead, play it in a terminal or command line application.
- If you want to submit any scores or decide to speedrun this game, submit scores at https://tirimid.net/misc/bavis.html
